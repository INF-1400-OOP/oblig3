    landed : bool
        Attribute to keep track of if the spacecraft has landed. (default True)
    thrust: bool
        Attribute to keep track of if the spacecraft is applying thrust. (default False)
    prev_shot : bool
        Attribute to keep track of the previous time when the spacecraft shot it's laser gun. (defaul 0)

        Attribute to keep track of if the spacecraft has exploded. (defaul False)

    Methods
    -------
    update(walls)
        updates object once per frame
    up()
        method for what happens when a up key is pressed.
